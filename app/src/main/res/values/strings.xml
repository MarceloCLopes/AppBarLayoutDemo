    Humanity means extending unconditional love to each and every living being on Earth.
    A perfect example of humanity can be demonstrated by the following story.
    A king with a kind heart once saw a pigeon and an Eagle fighting.
    He possessed the ability of communicating with the birds and animals.
    The pigeon asked the king to save him from the eagle.
    The king told the eagle that he is ready to pay any price in return for saving the pigeon.
    The eagle asks the king to give him the equal amount of flesh to the weight of the flesh of the pigeon.

    \n
    Agreeing to the Eagle’s condition, the king starts chopping off his own flesh equal to the flesh of the pigeon.
